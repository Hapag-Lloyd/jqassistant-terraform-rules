# jqassistant-terraform-rules
Rules for [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/) to ensure quality of Terraform files. They use the [HCL Plugin](https://github.com/jqassistant-contrib/jqassistant-hcl-plugin) for jQAssistant.

Copy the rules from src/main/resources/META-INF into your own jQAssistant Plugin and adjust them to your needs. See this [tutorial](https://101.jqassistant.org/sharing-rules-between-projects/index.html). You can't use this plugin as it has not been published to a public maven registry.
